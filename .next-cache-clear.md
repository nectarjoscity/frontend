# Cache Clearing Instructions

If you're seeing different designs between local and remote:

## For Local Development:
1. Stop the dev server
2. Run: `npm run clean` or `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

## For Remote/Production:
1. Clear build cache on your hosting platform
2. Rebuild the project
3. Clear CDN cache if using one
4. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

## Build Commands:
- `npm run build` - Standard production build (recommended)
- `npm run build:turbo` - Build with Turbopack (experimental, may cause differences)

## Common Issues:
- Turbopack in production builds can cause inconsistencies
- Browser cache may show old version
- CDN cache may need manual clearing
- Build cache on hosting platform may need clearing
